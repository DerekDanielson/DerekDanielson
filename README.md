- I'm currently attending Springboard FullStack program with the intent to become a front-end Developer.

- I am currently looking for a role as a front-end Dev.

- What I love and what motivates me in coding is the fact that it's like having super powers!  To be able to create anything is an amazing capability to me!

- I've been in the technical field for 13 yrs.  I have held positions as end-user support for Apple and Android devices, Desktop Support for BlueCross BlueShield and Service Desk to support end-users at Presbyterian Hospitals.  Working the Service Desk, I have supported everything from E-Pads, PCs to life support systems.  I was also involed with training new Service Desk agents as well as support managers.
